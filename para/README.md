# Subjective rating with a continuous scale

Using psychpy's continuous scale, the subject can respond with a slider to the SAM [[1](1)] scale. Images for this experiment are taken from the NAPS dataset [[2](2)].
The images' name is included in the `img.xlsx` list. The original valence arousal mean and standard deviation are also kept in this list.
